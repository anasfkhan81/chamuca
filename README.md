# Chamuça
This repository hosts the latest versions of the materials which are used to generate the chamuça lexical resource. 

## Introduction 

**CHAMUÇA (Cultural HeritAge and Multilingual Understanding through lexiCal Archives)** is a project which aims to document Portuguese borrowings in contemporary Asian languages. CHAMUÇA is also the name of the language resource which results from the project. This language resource will be published in successive versions as a linguistic knowledge graph in RDF. At the time of writing (05/06/25), we have a first version of CHAMUÇA which describes Portuguese borrowings.  In the first stage of the project we are focusing on South Asian languages and Malaysian/Indonesian but would like to add languages covering a wider area. 

### Background

### CHAMUÇA as an open, crowd-resourced dataset
### CHAMUÇA as a Linked Data Language Resource

## Adding a language

The idea is for each language to have the following information for each potential Portuguese borrowing.
