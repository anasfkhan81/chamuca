# Chamuça
This repository hosts the latest versions of the materials which are used to generate the chamuça lexical resource. 

## Introduction 
In this section we describe the aims of the project 

In this first stage we are focusing on South Asian languages and Indonesian but would like to add languages covering a wider area. 

### Chamuça as a Linked Data Language Resource
