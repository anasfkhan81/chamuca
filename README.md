## Summary 
The current document describes the Chamuça project, its aim and the current state of its progress. It will also describe the language resource of the same name, which is one of the products of the project, how it is structured and how to access it. It also provides information on how to contribute to the project and the r resource. 


## Introduction 

**Cultural HeritAge and Multilingual Understanding through lexiCal Archives (CHAMUÇA)** is a project in the area of historical contact linguistics which aims to document Portuguese borrowings in contemporary Asian languages.  CHAMUÇA is also the name of the language resource which results from the project. This language resource will be published in successive versions as a linguistic knowledge graph in RDF;  at the time of writing (05/06/25), we have a first version of CHAMUÇA which describes Portuguese borrowings in Urdu and Hindi.  In the first stage of the project we are focusing on South Asian languages and Malaysian/Indonesian but would like to add languages covering a wider area in the future. 
The aims of the project are as follows: 
- Help to make this part of history better known in an accessible machine actionable form, in our case by creating a knowledge graph of Portuguese borrowings into Asian languages with separate lexicons for each language and a indexical Portuguese lexicon
- Model this graph in RDF using the OntoLex-Lemon model and and make it accessible via a SPARQL endpoint; publish it with an open license and add it to the linguistic linked open data cloud,
- Bring together relevant lexical information on this topic from different sources, including Wiktionary, Wikipedia, and making reference to lexicographic information, but in particular...
- Extract the relevant details from Dalgado's lexicon and compare it/combine it with information from the above resources, helping to make Dalgado's important scholarship more accessible to modern day researchers as well as a wider public 

## Background
The influence of the Portuguese language in Asia began with the so-called Age of Discovery (Era dos Descobrimentos in Portuguese) in the 15th and 16th centuries, a period of unprecedented maritime expansion for what was then the Kingdom of Portugal. In particular, during that time several trading posts were established on the Malabar coast, including locations such as Cochin, Cannanore, Quilon, Cranganor, Tanor, and Calicut, giving the Portuguese their first foothold in the continent. Over the next few centuries, and thanks to extensive contact with numerous Asian cultures through trade and colonisation, the Portuguese language was able to leave behind a profound linguistic legacy in the whole of Asia. As Cardoso (2016, p. 71) states, “A língua portuguesa encaixou-se na região asiática ao ponto de se converter em importante língua franca de comérico e diplomacia” [The Portuguese language became deeply rooted in the Asian region to the extent that it evolved into an important lingua franca for commerce and diplomacy]. Despite subsequent, largely successful, moves towards challenging Portuguese dominance in the region by other colonial powers such as the Dutch, French and English, Portugal maintained a presence in colonies such as Goa, Daman, Diu, East Timor, and Macau well into the 20th century.
Today, traces of this influence can still be seen in religious practices and various local cuisines as well as in linguistic borrowings, including toponyms, and, more broadly speaking, the linguistic identities of numerous different Asian communities. The Portuguese language, once an instrument of trade and empire-building, has inadvertently sown seeds in the rich linguistic soil of Asia, cultivating a lexical heritage that continues to exert a strong influence on modern vernaculars. This influence can be profound, often surfacing in unexpected cultural contexts and leaving behind a rich, indelible legacy that the CHAMUÇA project aims to explore and document. By identifying words of Portuguese origin in Asian languages, the scope of the CHAMUÇA project, we not only document the spread of the Portuguese language in a more global context but also facilitate the study of how these languages adapt and incorporate foreign elements over time.

## Dalgado and the _Influência do Vocabulário Português em Línguas Asiáticas_
Sebastian Rodolfo Dalgado was a Portuguese Catholic priest, linguist, and orientalist born in Assagão, Goa, in 1855—then a Portuguese colony. Deeply rooted in both Indo-Portuguese and Catholic traditions, Dalgado became one of the most prominent figures in the study of Lusophone linguistic influence in Asia. His scholarly trajectory bridged European philological methods with a nuanced understanding of local Asian languages and cultures.

### Clerical and Academic Career
Dalgado entered the seminary in Goa and was later ordained a priest.

He studied theology and linguistics and eventually taught at the Papal Seminary in Kandy, Sri Lanka, before returning to Portugal, where he became professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology at the University of Lisbon.

He was a member of various scholarly institutions, including the Lisbon Academy of Sciences and the Royal Asiatic Society.

### Focus on Portuguese Contact Linguistics
Dalgado's most significant scholarly contribution lies in his pioneering work on lexical borrowings from Portuguese into Asian languages. At a time when the linguistic impact of European colonial powers in Asia was poorly documented, Dalgado's research opened a new field of study: Luso-Asian contact linguistics.

## Adding a language

The idea is for each language to have the following information for each potential Portuguese borrowing.
