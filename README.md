## Summary 
The current document describes the Chamuça project and language resource, how it is structured and how to access it. It also provides information on how to contribute to the resource. 


## Introduction 

**Cultural HeritAge and Multilingual Understanding through lexiCal Archives (CHAMUÇA)** is a project which aims to document Portuguese borrowings in contemporary Asian languages. CHAMUÇA is also the name of the language resource which results from the project. This language resource will be published in successive versions as a linguistic knowledge graph in RDF. At the time of writing (05/06/25), we have a first version of CHAMUÇA which describes Portuguese borrowings.  In the first stage of the project we are focusing on South Asian languages and Malaysian/Indonesian but would like to add languages covering a wider area. 

## Background
The influence of the Portuguese language in Asia began with the so-called Age of Discovery (Era dos Descobrimentos in Portuguese) in the 15th and 16th centuries, a period of unprecedented maritime expansion for what was then the Kingdom of Portugal. In particular, during that time several trading posts were established on the Malabar coast, including locations such as Cochin, Cannanore, Quilon, Cranganor, Tanor, and Calicut, giving the Portuguese their first foothold in the continent. Over the next few centuries, and thanks to extensive contact with numerous Asian cultures through trade and colonisation, the Portuguese language was able to leave behind a profound linguistic legacy in the whole of Asia. As Cardoso (2016, p. 71) states, “A língua portuguesa encaixou-se na região asiática ao ponto de se converter em importante língua franca de comérico e diplomacia” [The Portuguese language became deeply rooted in the Asian region to the extent that it evolved into an important lingua franca for commerce and diplomacy]. Despite subsequent, largely successful, moves towards challenging Portuguese dominance in the region by other colonial powers such as the Dutch, French and English, Portugal maintained a presence in colonies such as Goa, Daman, Diu, East Timor, and Macau well into the 20th century.
Today, traces of this influence can still be seen in religious practices and various local cuisines as well as in linguistic borrowings, including toponyms, and, more broadly speaking, the linguistic identities of numerous different Asian communities. The Portuguese language, once an instrument of trade and empire-building, has inadvertently sown seeds in the rich linguistic soil of Asia, cultivating a lexical heritage that continues to exert a strong influence on modern vernaculars. This influence can be profound, often surfacing in unexpected cultural contexts and leaving behind a rich, indelible legacy that the CHAMUÇA project aims to explore and document. By identifying words of Portuguese origin in Asian languages, the scope of the CHAMUÇA project, we not only document the spread of the Portuguese language in a more global context but also facilitate the study of how these languages adapt and incorporate foreign elements over time.

## Adding a language

The idea is for each language to have the following information for each potential Portuguese borrowing.
