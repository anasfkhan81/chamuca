## Summary 
The current document describes the Chamuça project, its aim and the current state of its progress. It will also describe the language resource of the same name, which is one of the products of the project, how it is structured and how to access it. It also provides information on how to contribute to the project and the r resource. 


## Introduction 

**Cultural HeritAge and Multilingual Understanding through lexiCal Archives (CHAMUÇA)** is a project in the area of historical contact linguistics which aims to document Portuguese borrowings in contemporary Asian languages.  CHAMUÇA is also the name of the language resource which results from the project. This language resource will be published in successive versions as a linguistic knowledge graph in RDF;  at the time of writing (05/06/25), we have a first version of CHAMUÇA which describes Portuguese borrowings in Urdu and Hindi.  In the first stage of the project we are focusing on South Asian languages and Malaysian/Indonesian but would like to add languages covering a wider area in the future. 
The aims of the project are as follows: 
- Help to make this part of history better known in an accessible machine actionable form, in our case by creating a knowledge graph of Portuguese borrowings into Asian languages with separate lexicons for each language and a indexical Portuguese lexicon
- Model this graph in RDF using the OntoLex-Lemon model and and make it accessible via a SPARQL endpoint; publish it with an open license and add it to the linguistic linked open data cloud,
- Bring together relevant lexical information on this topic from different sources, including Wiktionary, Wikipedia, and making reference to lexicographic information, but in particular...
- Extract the relevant details from Dalgado's lexicon and compare it/combine it with information from the above resources, helping to make Dalgado's important scholarship more accessible to modern day researchers as well as a wider public 

## Background
### The Impact of Portuguese in Asis
The influence of the Portuguese language in Asia starts with the so-called Age of Discovery (Era dos Descobrimentos in Portuguese) in the 15th and 16th centuries, a period of unprecedented maritime expansion for the then Kingdom of Portugal. During that period, several trading posts were established on the Malabar coast, including locations such as Cochin and Calicut, giving the Portuguese their first foothold in the continent. 

Over the next few centuries, thanks to extensive contact with numerous parts of Asia through trade and colonisation, the Portuguese language was able to leave behind a profound linguistic legacy in the whole of the continent.  To quote Cardoso (2016) “A língua portuguesa encaixou-se na região asiática ao ponto de se converter em importante língua franca de comérico e diplomacia” [The Portuguese language became deeply rooted in the Asian region to the extent that it evolved into an important lingua franca for commerce and diplomacy]. 

With time, the Portuguese presence in the region was challenged by other European colonial powers such as the Dutch, French and English, although Portugal was able to keep its colonies Goa, Daman, Diu, East Timor, and Macau well into the 20th century. Today, traces of the influence of the Portuguese can still be seen in religious practices and various local cuisines in different parts of Asia, as well as in numerous linguistic borrowings and even some surviving Portuguese creoles (Dalgado (2016)). 

The aim of the Chamuça project is to trace the impact of the Portuguese language on various different Asian languages.  
By identifying words of Portuguese origin in Asian languages, the scope of the CHAMUÇA project, we not only document the spread of the Portuguese language in a more global context but also facilitate the study of how these languages adapt and incorporate foreign elements over time.

## Dalgado and the _Influência do Vocabulário Português em Línguas Asiáticas_
Sebastian Rodolfo Dalgado was a Portuguese Catholic priest, linguist, and orientalist born in Assagão, Goa, in 1855—then a Portuguese colony. Deeply rooted in both Indo-Portuguese and Catholic traditions, Dalgado became one of the most prominent figures in the study of Lusophone linguistic influence in Asia. His scholarly trajectory bridged European philological methods with a nuanced understanding of local Asian languages and cultures.

### Clerical and Academic Career
Dalgado entered the seminary in Goa and was later ordained a priest.

He studied theology and linguistics and eventually taught at the Papal Seminary in Kandy, Sri Lanka, before returning to Portugal, where he became professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology at the University of Lisbon.

He was a member of various scholarly institutions, including the Lisbon Academy of Sciences and the Royal Asiatic Society.

### Focus on Portuguese Contact Linguistics
Dalgado's most significant scholarly contribution lies in his pioneering work on lexical borrowings from Portuguese into Asian languages. At a time when the linguistic impact of European colonial powers in Asia was poorly documented, Dalgado's research opened a new field of study: Luso-Asian contact linguistics.

## Adding a language

The idea is for each language to have the following information for each potential Portuguese borrowing.
