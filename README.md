## Summary 
The current document describes the Chamuça project, its aim and the current state of its progress. It will also describe the language resource of the same name, which is one of the products of the project, how it is structured and how to access it. It also provides information on how to contribute to the project and the resource. 


## Introduction 

**Cultural HeritAge and Multilingual Understanding through lexiCal Archives (CHAMUÇA)** is an interdisciplinary collaboration in the area of historical contact linguistics which aims to document the impact of the Portuguese on the languages of Asian languages, while also making earlier scholarship and research on this topic more accessible and easier to use.  As well as being the name of our project, CHAMUÇA is also the name of the language resource which is produced through this collaboration. This language resource will be published in successive versions as a linguistic knowledge graph in RDF, making it a test case for the use of **linguistic linked data** in disseminating this kind of cultural and linguistic information.  And of course the name of our project also evokes, chamuça, the fried snack which is a well known example of intercultural culinary exchange.

At the time of writing (05/06/25), we have a first version of CHAMUÇA which describes Portuguese borrowings in Urdu and Hindi.  In the first stage of the project we are focusing on South Asian languages and Malaysian/Indonesian but would like to add languages covering a wider area in the future. 

The aims of the project are as follows: 
- Help to make this part of history better known in an accessible machine actionable form, in our case by creating a knowledge graph of Portuguese borrowings into Asian languages with separate lexicons for each language and a indexical Portuguese lexicon
- Model this graph in RDF using the OntoLex-Lemon model and and make it accessible via a SPARQL endpoint; publish it with an open license and add it to the linguistic linked open data cloud,
- Bring together relevant lexical information on this topic from different sources, including Wiktionary, Wikipedia, and making reference to lexicographic information, but in particular...
- Extract the relevant details from Dalgado's lexicon and compare it/combine it with information from the above resources, helping to make Dalgado's important scholarship more accessible to modern day researchers as well as a wider public 

## Background
### The Impact of Portuguese in Asia
The influence of the Portuguese language in Asia starts with the so-called Age of Discovery (_Era dos Descobrimentos_ in Portuguese) during the 15th and 16th centuries. In this period, sailors and colonists from the kingodm of Portugal were able to establish a network of colonies and trading posts along the South Asian coast, beginning with the Malabar coast in India, and including locations such as Cochin and Calicut. 

Over time, these footholds expanded into a wider system of settlements and trade routes spanning many parts of ths content. One inevitable consequence of this expansion was that **Portuguese emerged as a key language of trade and diplomacy in Asia** To quote Cardoso (2016) “A língua portuguesa encaixou-se na região asiática ao ponto de se converter em importante língua franca de comérico e diplomacia” [The Portuguese language became deeply rooted in the Asian region to the extent that it evolved into an important lingua franca for commerce and diplomacy]. 

The Portuguese language began to exert a significant influence on the languages of Asia—starting on the western coast of what is now India, spreading to Sri Lanka, Bengal, and then further east to Indonesia, China, and Japan. This linguistic impact is still very much present today, even if it's not always recognized by speakers of these languages.

The idea behind CHAMUçA then is to make this story both more visible and more accessible—both to researchers and to a wider public. That is, we intend to trace the ongoing legacy of colonisation and trade as reflected in the vocabularies of modern Asian languages, drawing on both contemporary and historical scholarship in the field.  Another aim of Chamuça is also to bring awareness to the pioneering work of the early 20th century scholar Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado.

## Dalgado and the _Influência do Vocabulário Português em Línguas Asiáticas_
Sebastian Rodolfo Dalgado was a Portuguese Catholic priest, linguist, and orientalist born in Assagão, Goa, in 1855—then a Portuguese colony. Deeply rooted in both Indo-Portuguese and Catholic traditions, Dalgado became one of the most prominent figures in the study of Lusophone linguistic influence in Asia. His scholarly trajectory bridged European philological methods with a nuanced understanding of local Asian languages and cultures.

### Clerical and Academic Career
Dalgado entered the seminary in Goa and was later ordained a priest.

He studied theology and linguistics and eventually taught at the Papal Seminary in Kandy, Sri Lanka, before returning to Portugal, where he became professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology at the University of Lisbon.

He was a member of various scholarly institutions, including the Lisbon Academy of Sciences and the Royal Asiatic Society.

### Focus on Portuguese Contact Linguistics
Dalgado's most significant scholarly contribution lies in his pioneering work on lexical borrowings from Portuguese into Asian languages. At a time when the linguistic impact of European colonial powers in Asia was poorly documented, Dalgado's research opened a new field of study: Luso-Asian contact linguistics.

## Adding a language

The idea is for each language to have the following information for each potential Portuguese borrowing.
